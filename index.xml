      <description>Quantity always trumps quality Just stumbled upon the idea of quantity always trumping quality. Excited to try it out!
Accelerated C++ Currently reading the book Accelerated C++. It takes the approach of teaching you purely C++, rather than building on top of C knowledge. While it isn&amp;rsquo;t an exhaustive text, it claims to teach you the essentials. Afterwards, it directs you to more complete texts as well as learning from more focused sources.</description>

      <description>The lofty goals I set for myself seem to be the most fun to achieve. However, in the midst of the journey, I tend to focus too much on what I have yet to achieve, rather than what I have achieved so far.
